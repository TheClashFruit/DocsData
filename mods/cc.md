Unable to find anything in the new inventory layout? Well then this mod is for you! It brings the old creative inventory layout (pre 1.19.3) to 1.20+.

## FAQ

### Mod Compatibility
Probably not compatible with mods that add items to the default item groups, however a compatibility layer is planned.

### Missing Items
I'm doing my best to include all items including new ones from 1.20 but I might miss some so please report them on the issues page or my Discord server.

## Known Issues

### Custom Item Groups
If there is only one custom item group then the page selector will not show, most likely due to the fact that this inventory has one less tab. I'm working on a fix.
